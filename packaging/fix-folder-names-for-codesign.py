"""Fix the macOS application to allow codesign.

Take one or more .app as arguments: "Gaphor-X.X.X.app".

Folders containing a dot in their name like gdk-pixbuf-2.0 are not
allowed in the `Contents/MacOS folder. This script fixes these issues by:
- Moving problematic folders from MacOS to Resources
- Creating the appropriate symbolic link

This script is originally based on:
https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Recipe-OSX-Code-Signing-Qt
from MickaÃ«l Schoentgen (BoboTiG) and Ben Hagen (cbenhagen)
